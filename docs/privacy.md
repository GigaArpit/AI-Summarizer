# Privacy Policy for the Extension

The "AI Summarizer" Chrome extension doesn't track its users in any possible way. It does not collect, store, or share any personal data, browsing history, or usage information. All processing is performed locally on your device or via secure, privacy-conscious APIs, ensuring your data remains private and secure.

We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of user privacy. The extension operates without requiring login credentials or access to personal information. Any text inputted for summarization is processed solely for the purpose of generating summaries and is not stored or transmitted to any third-party servers unless explicitly stated otherwise.

This extension leverages Google's on-device Gemini Nano LLM for efficient and secure processing. For more details about Gemini Nano LLM and its capabilities, please visit the following link: <https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in>.
